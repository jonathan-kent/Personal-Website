        I used ray marching and signed distance functions to draw a scene onto an HTML canvas using JavaScript.
        The scene is lit using diffuse lighting and includes shadows. I implemented signed distance
        functions for a sphere, a box, and a plane. The lightsource rotates slowly around the scene,
        but with three objects, the scene runs very slowly.

        Before rendering a full 3D scene using ray marching, I created a 2D visualization of sphere tracing.
        The canvas displays the circles that represent the ray marching steps leaving the "camera". The
        "camera" turns red when it detects a collision.<br><br>
        Left and right arrow keys rotate the "camera" and the up and down arrow keys move the "camera" forward
        and back. Clicking on the scene adds a random shape to the scene.

        This project allows you to create a crossword grid and then attempts to fill it using words taken from Dictionary.com and
        Wikipedia article titles. Custom words can be filled into the crossword before the rest of the crossword is filled.
        Unfortunately, pulling from such a large pool of possible words creates many crosswords with very obscure words and acronyms.
        Words were collected using Python and Selenium, and the crossword is created and filled using Java.

        Google Trends limits the number of comparisons to 5 search terms. I wanted to make a visualization of sports teams based on
        Google search popularity, so I used Python and the Pytrends API to compare all teams in a league to each other.
        I used this project to create maps of NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, and MLS teams in the United States.

        </div>
        This project creates a visualization of binary trees. Every binary tree has a unique signature created by a pre-order traversal.
        Each node is represented by two decimals. The first digit represents a left child and the second represents the right child. for
        example, 01 represents a node with a right child, but no left child.<br><br>
        Trees can be constructed by clicking on the nodes or by entering a valid binary tree signature in either
        decimal or binary representation.

        This project was created after seeing that a skilled solitaire player wins around 43% of games. I attempted to see what percentage
        of games of solitaire a simple AI could win. The AI I created is capable of winning games, but it is no where near a 43% win rate.

        <h3>Instagram Bot</h3><br>
        After seeing that the Instagram API would be deprecated in 2020, I decided to use Python and Selenium to create an Instagram
        bot that analyzes the likes on recent Instagram posts. It looks at the previous four posts and collects the lists of likes for each
        photo. It then looks at the most recent post and displays likes from people who did not like many of the previous posts,
        and people who liked many of the previous posts, but not the most recent one.

        In this project, I created a few experiments using screenshots of topographic maps. One of the more interesting looking experiments
        was looking at the relative heights of the terrain. The Java program converts the topographic map into a height map and then
        displays parts of the terrain that would appear higher or lower from the perspective of someone standing at the mouse cursors location.
